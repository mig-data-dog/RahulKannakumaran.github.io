          <p>We made and used a discord group to communicate with each other throughout the duration of this project. In
            the discord we:<br><br>
            Discussed when we would meetup to work on our presentation and porfolio.<br> Added all of the notes which we
            found during our research.<br>
            Traded all of the code we wanted to add to the website (to promote code management).<br> Made a list of
            every resource which we used when researching.<br>
            Found all of the photos we wanted to use in the website and included their source when posting them.<br><br>
          </p>

          <p>
            We meetup as a group after every COMP501 lecture as we always had a break after this. During these meetings
            some of the things we discussed were:
          <ul>
            <li>What material we should add to our slide</li>
            <li>What resources we should use</li>
            <li>What role is best for what team member</li>
            <li>What we want the website to look like</li>
            <li>What risks we want to focus on and how those risks impact Machine Learning</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            We also created a google docs where we would write all of the information we wanted to add to the website.
            <br><br>
            We used this google doc as the main way to give each other the information. And the final material which is
            added to the website is copied and pasted from this google docs.<br><br>
            This doc has made communication each others work so much easier. And allows for each team member to read
            over and fix any grammar/punctuation issues which may not have been found when it was intially written.
          </p>
          <p>
            The links to all of the documents showing teamwork are as follows:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18oobSEeTWYWflrJMPSEHxJWITMOC8NkOAQLOwJdMPyE/edit?usp=sharing">Slides </a></li>
